# customer_segmentation00_demographics
This is the first part of my customer segmentation series focusing on demographics
 A dummy e-commerce website data was generated randomly with 1000 customers and had features as;
 - customer id
 - age
 - purchaseamount
 - purchasefrequency
 - website visits
 - timeonsite
 - bounce rate
 - and state

The major features i used for this segmentation was age and gender which was succesfully encoded and clustered into different clusters for further analysis. kmean cluster with elbow point was used

Various visualization was also  created to give insights and for further analysis.
